Thanks to http://uidesigndaily.com/ ( @ildiesign ) for the design 

I was totally inspired( blown away ) by this design, 

So I üßê(thinking), "Why not try to recreate this design ?"
To get started easy, and to keep things simple,
I stuck with just HTML and CSS

[Target] was to get it done as fast as possible 

[Improvements] 

[ ] Potencial to be a react component
[ ] Potencial to be a tailwind component
[ ] Dynamic Component using JS
